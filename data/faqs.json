[{"question": "What are the Min & Max Trading Days?", "answer": "The FunderPro challenge has a minimum trading rule. To meet this objective, you must trade for at least 5 days during your challenge. This means you must open at least one position on each of these days. \nHow do you define a trading day?\nA trading day is defined as a day where at least one trade is executed. In the case that a trade is held over a number of days, the only day that will be considered a \"Trading Day\" is the day the position was opened. \nWhat's the maximum trading period?\nWe have no time limits to complete the challenge, this means your path to funding can be done at your own pace."}, {"question": "Can I Reset My Challenge?", "answer": "We want to empower our traders to succeed. If at any time you are in violation of one of our requirements your account will become ineligible for funding due to the success criteria not being met. However, you can reset your account at any time during your Phase 1 (Evaluation) of your challenge. \nHow does the reset help?\nIt's not a good feeling to fail, our reset function allows you to adapt your trading plan and strategy and try again for 20% less than the original cost.\nYou can reset your account by following the simple steps below: \n Access your funded account dashboard. [HYPERLINK: https://prop.funderpro.com/login?&utm_campaign=TOFf222]\n Navigate to the challenge you wish to reset.\n Simply click \"Reset Challenge\" and you're ready to go again.\nOnce you have successfully reset your challenge you will see a pop-up window highlighting your discounted price (20% Less) and the available payment options. Now all you have to do is confirm or cancel. Click \"Cancel\" if you do not wish to continue or \"Reset & Keep Trading\" to keep going."}, {"question": "I Have Passed Phase 2! What Next?", "answer": "In phases 1 and 2, all accounts are simulated to mimic actual market conditions. This means you will trade on a demo account.\nOnce you have been funded your account will be connected to a live trading account with an STP broker where you will trade with real capital. This is where you can earn an 80% profit share with the option to scale and reach an account balance of $5 million."}, {"question": "How Can I Withdraw Profits?", "answer": "You can simply request payouts for any profits that you generate on a weekly basis and we will process your payment as quickly as possible. In order to be eligible for a payout the following requirements are needed: \n Your first payout request can be requested after 7 days from the first trade \n Due to the current market state of BTC as a whole, we will only payout if your profit exceeds $100. This will be calculated on equity gain made by the trader during the previous week\nSubsequent payouts will happen on a weekly basis, each Friday at 12:00 MT4/MT5 Server time. \nWhat are the payout methods available: \nCurrently, you can withdraw your profits in BTC direct into your wallet. Once you have requested your payout we will review the request and aim to process it within 24-48 hours after the request has been submitted. Any payouts will ONLY be paid out to traders you have fully verified accounts and who have not breached any of your Funded Account requirements. \nYou can easily update your payment details at any time from your trader's portal, if or when you add new or edit existing payment details we will inform you via email as an extra measure of security."}, {"question": "Do I Trade Live or Demo?", "answer": "In phases 1 and 2, all accounts are simulated to mimic actual market conditions. This means you will trade on a demo account.\nOnce you have been funded your account will be connected to a live trading account with an STP broker where you will trade with real capital. This is where you can earn an 80% profit share with the option to scale and reach an account balance of $5 million."}, {"question": "How Does the Overall Drawdown Work?", "answer": "For the duration of your challenge, the capital in your FunderPro trader account cannot at any given time drop below 10%.\nFor example: \nIf you have a starting balance of $100,000, 10% of this equals $10,000. This means if your account falls below $90,000 at any given moment you are in violation of the \"overall drawdown\" rule. \nHow do I calculate Daily Drawdown?\nThe Maximum Daily Loss of 5% has a constant value of 5% of your initial account's size. This means that if a trader has a $100,000 account, their maximum daily loss would be $5,000 (5% of $100,000) at any given time during the challenge.\n\nIt's important to note that the maximum daily loss of 5% is based on the trader's equity at the end of the day (EOD), which is calculated at 00:00 server time GMT+3 5 pm EST (depending on the changes in daylight savings time). This includes both the realized and unrealized profit and loss (P&L) of the trader's open positions.\nFor example, in the case of a 100.000 account, if a trader has lost $4,999 on the first day of trading, their equity at the end of the day would be $95,001. The maximum daily loss threshold would reset the next day, allowing the trader to potentially lose up to $4,999 again without breaching the threshold.\nViolation of this rule will result in an automatic failure on your challenge account. The same Daily Drawdown applies to all 3 phases (Evaluation, Verification, and Funded) of every challenge."}, {"question": "Do I Trade With Real Funds?", "answer": "Once you have passed our 2 phase evaluation, FunderPro traders will have the same capital to trade with as initially chosen for their preceding evaluation (phase 1) and verification (phase 2) phases. Your FunderPro Funded Account will be connected to a live STP trading account with real capital, an industry first. \nIt's from your live account where we generate real profits, and you are entitled to 80% of the profits you earn on the account. \nNote: We don't provide account upgrades, please be sure to choose the account size that suits you from the beginning. This initial capital is what you will trade on your Funded Account. \nIf you are successful, prove you are able to build consistent profits and have a winning trading strategy in the long run, you can scale your account. \nWhat does it mean to trade with an STP broker?\nWe want all our traders to succeed, this is why we are the only prop firm to connect all Funded Traders to an STP account. STP (Straight Through Processing) means that we will connect you to tier-1 liquidity, and your orders will be passed directly to a counterparty without passing them through a dealing desk."}, {"question": "How Does the Daily Drawdown Work?", "answer": "Traders can have a maximum daily drawdown of 5% from their initial starting equity (including all floating losses & profits), within a 24-hour period starting at 5 pm EST. \nFor example: \nIf you have a starting balance of $200,000, 5% of this equals $10,000. This means if your account falls below $190,000 within any given day you are in violation of the \"daily drawdown\" rule. On the other hand, if you end any given day with a profit let's say $10,000, your starting capital will increase to $210,000 and your new maximum daily loss will now be $10,500. \nHow do I calculate Daily Drawdown?\nThe Maximum Daily Loss of 5% has a constant value of 5% of your initial account's size. This means that if a trader has a $100,000 account, their maximum daily loss would be $5,000 (5% of $100,000) at any given time during the challenge.\n\nIt's important to note that the maximum daily loss of 5% is based on the trader's equity at the end of the day (EOD), which is calculated at 00:00 server time GMT+3 5 pm EST (depending on the changes in daylight savings time).

The same Daily Drawdown applies to all 3 phases (Evaluation, Verification, and Funded) of every challenge. \nBear in mind that we don't recommend trading one hour before and after the market rollover, because of bad market conditions caused by low liquidity and high volatility."}, {"question": "What Leverage is Available?", "answer": "Since we allow traders to hold positions overnight and over the weekend we have lowered the leverage across certain instruments to protect against any extreme volatility or price movements. We are delighted to offer the best available leverage across our challenge account in comparison to other prop firms. \nBelow is a breakdown of the leverage available across different assets: \n 1:100 - Forex & Crypto \n 1:100 - Metals, Indices & Energies \nWhat does it mean to trade with leverage?\nLeverage in trading enables you to open a trading position using a small amount of capital in order to take a much larger position in the market. By borrowing money to invest, you can amplify your returns and potentially earn more than you would have without using leverage.\nFor example:\nIf you have $5,000, you can leverage your trading position up to 100 times or more. So, if you leveraged at 100 to 1, you would be exposing yourself to managing a position of $500,000 in the market."}, {"question": "What is the Consistency Rule?", "answer": "What is the Consistency Rule?\nThe Consistency Rule in FunderPro is designed to ensure you achieve steady and sustainable profits while effectively managing risk. The rule states that the earnings of your best trading day should not exceed 60% of your total profits and comes into play only during Phase 2 (Verification) of the Funded Account Challenge.\nWhy is the Consistency Rule Important?\nFunderPro's Consistency Rule aids in the cultivation of consistent profits and the avoidance of emotion-driven trading. By ensuring your most profitable day falls below 60% of your overall profits, you can better manage your risk-reward ratio (RRR) and develop a more sustainable trading approach. This rule assists FunderPro in identifying the top professional traders to fund.\nWhen is the Consistency Rule required and how is it calculated?\nThe Consistency Rule applies solely to Phase 2 (Verification) of the Funded Account Challenge. Here, you have the chance to demonstrate your ability to manage risk effectively and build consistent success. \nThe calculation is as follows: Best Day Profit / Overall Profit = Best Day % of Total Profit \nLet's illustrate this with a new example: \nImagine a $25,000 account with a Phase 2 profit target of $2,000 (8%). The daily profit should never exceed $1,200, which is 60% of total profits. Consider this scenario: \n You reach your target and make a total profit of $2,000.\n You earn a $1,200 profit in a single day.\nResult: You do not pass the Challenge. \nTo succeed, you should devise a strategy that prevents you from exceeding a $1,200 daily profit. Once you reach a total profit of $2,000, you will pass the Challenge as you have demonstrated that you can profit consistently without relying on risky large trades. \nWhat is meant by the Recommended Best Day?\nGiven that your best trading day should remain below 60% of your total profit, we recommend that you set a daily profit target below this threshold. This strategy will help you maintain consistency and lock in daily profits.\nHere are examples of recommended best day profits by account size:\n\n                                 Account Size \n                                Profit Target \n                             Recommended Best Day\n$25k Account \n$2,000\nLess than $1,200\n$50k Account\n$4,000\nLess than $2,400\n$100k Account\n$8,000\nLess than $4,800\n$200k Account\n$16,000\nLess than $9,600"}, {"question": "What's The Maximum Number of Accounts Allowed?", "answer": "We don't place any limit on the number of accounts that you can purchase either one after the other or in parallel. However, When it comes to active accounts we allow you up to 24, this depends on the account size combination. The maximum total initial capital on all your accounts cannot exceed $400,000. \nWhat capital is available? \nBreaking down our 4 challenges: $25,000, $50,000, $100,000 & $200,000 means you can have: \n 16 $25k accounts \n 8 $50k accounts \n 4 $100k accounts \n 2 $200k accounts \nor a combination of all capital up to $400k! With that said, you can scale up your capital as far as $5 million."}, {"question": "Am I Required to Have a Verified Account?", "answer": "You have now passed phase 2 but before we issue any Funded Account and allow you to trade on your live account you are required to verify your identity, This should take no longer than a few minutes to complete.\nFollow the below steps to verify your identity: \n   Once you have completed the verification phase and we are happy you met all requirements our support team will guide you through the next steps.

Profit Target means that traders need to reach a total profit in the sum of closed trades on their challenge account within the duration of their challenge.\nFor example:\nIf you choose an account balance of $50,000, your profit target for Phase 1 (Evaluation) will be $5,000, and $4,000 for Phase 2 (Verification). \nIf you are in violation of this rule this will lead to an automatic failure of your challenge account."}, {"question": "Can I Scale My Account?", "answer": "The FunderPro scaling plan, available on both our $100k & $200k challenges, not only allows you to increase your balance but over time you can also increase your potential payout by simply proving yourself as a consistent, profitable trader. \nWhy our Scaling Plan is the best on the market?\n A very generous 50% increase in account balance every 3 months, all the way up to $5 million\n Fair and safe profit eligibility requirement (10% consecutively for 3 months)\n Trading goals remain the same \n Profit split of 80/20 in your favour \nWhat are the requirements?\nTo be eligible traders must meet a 10% profit target consecutively for 3 months and we will reward you with a 50% balance increase of up to $5 million. \nFor example: \nIf you start with a $100k account and are profitable for 3 consecutive months with at least 10% profit you will qualify for a 50% scale increase.
